# Introduction to shadcn Registry

## Overview

The shadcn CLI enables developers to establish and operate their own code registry systems. This capability facilitates the distribution of custom components, hooks, pages, configuration files, and other resources across various projects.

## Key Capabilities

According to the documentation, "The registry works with any project type and any framework, and is not limited to React." This universality makes it a flexible solution for diverse development environments.

The registry functions as "A distribution system for code," allowing teams to share and manage custom assets systematically.

## Getting Started Path

The documentation guides users through an implementation process beginning with component creation and progressing toward publishing for broader use. The next steps involve progressive learning through several documentation sections:

1. **Getting Started** — Foundational setup and building procedures
2. **Authentication** — Security implementation for registry protection
3. **Namespaces** — Configuration approaches using namespace organization
4. **Examples** — Practical demonstrations and configuration patterns
5. **Schema** — Technical specifications for registry.json files

This structured approach helps developers understand both foundational concepts and advanced configurations needed to establish functional registries.
