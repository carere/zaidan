# Home

Welcome to a deliberately long page used to stress-test scrolling,
layout, and content rendering. Everything below is placeholder text,
examples, and layout patterns that mimic real documentation.

## What this page is for

- Exercise long-form typography and spacing
- Validate heading anchors and table of contents
- Confirm code blocks, tables, and lists render correctly
- Test search indexing and deep-link behavior

## Quick tour

### Layout sections

This page includes several common documentation patterns. Paragraphs
vary in length so you can see how line-height and max-width feel at
different breakpoints. Sections are intentionally verbose to make the
page tall enough for scroll and performance testing.

### Design tokens

Use this area to validate spacing between headings, body text, and
inline code. The goal is to make sure the page remains readable across
themes and that headings do not collapse into the content above them.

> Tip: Toggle themes and fonts while scrolling to confirm the layout
> remains stable. This blockquote is here to verify callout styling.

## Installation (fake)

The following commands are placeholders used to test code blocks. They
do not correspond to a real package or version.

```bash
pnpm add zaidan-ui
pnpm add solid-js
pnpm add tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

### Configuration snippet

```json
{
  "ui": {
    "preset": "zaidan",
    "theme": "system",
    "radius": "md"
  }
}
```

## Usage example

Below is a sample snippet to confirm syntax highlighting and code block
spacing. The content is intentionally simple.

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from "zaidan-ui";

export default function Demo() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Card.Header>
        <Card.Title>Example</Card.Title>
        <Card.Description>Fake content for testing</Card.Description>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Content>
        <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Sections you can skim

### Component overview

Components are grouped by purpose: actions, layout, data display, and
feedback. These paragraphs are here to simulate real documentation.
They also help verify how multi-line text wraps in narrow containers.

### Do's and don'ts

1. Do keep headings short and meaningful.
2. Do provide clear examples with minimal noise.
3. Don't mix multiple concepts in a single example.
4. Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning.

### Compatibility notes

Text here is intentionally repetitive to generate length. The idea is
to make sure the page can handle a variety of text lengths and styles
without layout shifts or overlapping margins.

## Table for alignment

| Area | Goal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typography | Check line-height and rhythm | Use different font sizes |
| Code blocks | Validate padding and overflow | Include long lines |
| Lists | Ensure list markers align | Test nested spacing |
| Tables | Confirm borders and zebra styles | Add enough rows |

## More filler content

This paragraph is part of the filler content block. It should be long
enough to wrap across multiple lines on desktop screens, and still feel
comfortable on mobile. The next paragraph repeats the idea with a
slightly different cadence so you can test word spacing and readability.

Another paragraph continues the filler. The goal is to provide a tall
page with varied elements: headings, lists, tables, blockquotes, and
code blocks. The content itself is intentionally generic.

### Example: simple API surface

```tsx
type Theme = "light" | "dark" | "system";

interface ZaidanConfig {
  theme: Theme;
  radius: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  density: "comfortable" | "compact";
}

export const config: ZaidanConfig = {
  theme: "system",
  radius: "md",
  density: "comfortable"
};
```

## FAQ

**Is this real documentation?**  
No. It's intentionally fake content for layout testing.

**Can I delete this later?**  
Yes. Replace it with real docs once you're done testing.

**Why is it so long?**  
To verify scrolling, performance, and layout stability.

If you need even more content, duplicate any section above or add
additional tables and code samples. The exact wording is not important.
