## Native Select vs Select

- Use `NativeSelect` when you need native browser behavior, better performance, or mobile-optimized dropdowns.
- Use `Select` when you need custom styling, animations, or complex interactions.

The `NativeSelect` component provides native HTML select functionality with consistent styling that matches your design system.

## Accessibility

- The component maintains all native HTML select accessibility features.
- Screen readers can navigate through options using arrow keys.
- The chevron icon is marked as `aria-hidden="true"` to avoid duplication.
- Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for additional context when needed.

```tsx showLineNumbers
<NativeSelect aria-label="Choose your preferred language">
  <NativeSelectOption value="en">English</NativeSelectOption>
  <NativeSelectOption value="es">Spanish</NativeSelectOption>
  <NativeSelectOption value="fr">French</NativeSelectOption>
</NativeSelect>
```
